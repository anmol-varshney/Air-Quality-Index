# ðŸ˜Ž Predicting Air Quality Index using Machine Learning

Different machine learning algorithms are taken into part to make prediction on some features like the presence of various harmful and useful gases. All this data is visualized with the help of heatmap, correlation matrix and even many minute things are performed. Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Neural Network are the algorithms on which model is trained to give results. Results of the entire algorithm are also pretty much good, which defines that algorithms are well suited for the task. Neural Network also defines the suitable loss that has extreme dominance on the performance, to judge the quality of the air.

#### About Dataset
This dataset looks at the various gases like NO, NO2, CO, SO2, O3, etc, and then checks how all this data is correlated to each other, features should lack multicollinearity. After all, this dataset has many null values which are filled to make data relevant. Dataset is basically tells the air quality in various cities. Target feature also has many missing values which are also operated. There are many aspects that are needed to be considered in cities like Mumbai so as to prevent the degradation of air quality. Due to global warming various gases like O3 presence is increasing in the air which definitely decreases the air quality.
